One approach is to transform categorical features into numerical representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. Another approach is to use distance metrics specifically designed for categorical data, such as the Jaccard distance or the Hamming distance. It is important to choose a suitable encoding scheme or distance metric that reflects the meaningful relationships between different categories."

It is also difficult to interpret the optimal number of clusters from a dendrogram."
